# Goals of the project

- Ready-to-go eCommerce website with an alternative to Shopify using Medusa
- Produce a faster and more responsive site than leading paystack competitors
- Modular design to provide as a template for other developers or users

# Reason for building the project

- Eventually will move away from Etsy and wanted to avoid Shopify
- Have my own dedicated shop for other products outside of Etsy's limitations
- Hands on experience with Medusa and Stripe integration for SvelteKit
